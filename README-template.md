## My process
As I am trying to get more organized and methodical about my process, here are the pre-planned steps I outlined before beginning my attempt. 

- Organize / structure HTML
  - [x] Add QR image
  - [x] Set correct headers for hierarchy
  - [x] Create container for the elements in the white box
  - [x] Update footer with correct credentials
- Create CSS Stylesheet
  - [x] Link to HTML file
  - [x] Place any prewritten <style> into the stylesheet
  - Colors
    - [x] background color for page
    - [x] background color for container
    - [x] font color for header
    - [x] font color for caption
  - Shapes
    - [x] round corners for the container
    - [x] round corners for the QR code
  - Fonts
    - [x] add fonts per style guide
  - Spacing
    - [x] ensure the padding b/t each element matches designs
    - [x] text aligned to the center
    - [x] the container itself should be centered on the page

Concepts I missed in my planning stage that ended up being relevant:
- [x] Added a universal selector for padding/margin/border-box - apparantly this is useful but need to understand why
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Imported a font through the html style sheet / google API
```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit">
```

- Sharpened process to simplify big tasks into smaller ones

### Continued development

- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox 
- FONTS
